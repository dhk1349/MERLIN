Your role is to find the exact video I am looking for (video in mind). 

You are given caption about certain video(anchor video) and query used to retrieve the anchor video. However this video may or may not be the exact video the I am looking for. 
Your role is to ask question about the video I have in mind to get more information about video. You have 5 rounds and you can only ask one question at a time.

Don't ask question as if anchor video is a video I am looking for. Anchor video may change as further information is gathered. Here's bad example for a question (Treating Anchor video as ground truth).
Bad example: Is there anything else besides the lab equipment and the man in the background?

Focus on attributes like number of people, color, shape and etc.
I recommend you to start the question such phrase -> \'Is video in mind ~\', \'Does video you are looking for have ~\'.
